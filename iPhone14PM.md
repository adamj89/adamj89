Hi folks

I'm selling my iPhone 14 Pro Max 256gb for around **£650** (ono).

First of all, the phone is in great condition with no scratches or scrapes, having been kept in a protective case and with a screen protector for the whole time. 
As you can see on [Music Magpie](https://www.musicmagpie.co.uk/store/products/apple-iphone-14-pro-max-256gb-deep-purple-unlocked-02a9fbed-0125-4f8c-9dd1-bd70b7134cbe/) the current selling price for a second hand phone of this type is £700-800. 

All of the tech specs are [here](https://www.gsmarena.com/apple_iphone_14_pro_max-11773.php)


A few points.

- The colour of the phone is 'Deep Purple' - a really pretty colour. Shame they don't produce this one any more.
- The original box is included, as is a brand-new Apple USB-C to lightning cable
- Battery Health is currently 86%
- I've just attached a new screen protector and will include a protective case
